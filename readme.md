<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I do not program in C# by choice, so this project will not reflect on my other work in Python or other languages.

This ERP System is made as an example of how ERP systems could look intergrated in a companys infrastructure.
In this ERP System you can create customers, product and place orders.
You can create, edit, delete and see lists of information put in the database.

You can track orders made by customers and always have control over your storage.
